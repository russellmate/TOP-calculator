## What I learned
This was a very tricky project for me. I really had to put all my knowledge of Javascript to the test. It also encouraged me to think differently in how I approached issues that would arise when trying to figure out how to implement some features. I would say that my ability to find solutions to problems using Google has improved with the project. 

This project was the first time that I had used objects in Javascript and it showed me how useful they can be instead of writing out big functions for every outcome.
